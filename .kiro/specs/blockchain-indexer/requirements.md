# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a blockchain indexer service that maintains real-time balance tracking for cryptocurrency addresses. The indexer processes incoming blocks, updates address balances accordingly, and provides balance query capabilities with rollback functionality for blockchain reorganizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blockchain application developer, I want to submit new blocks to the indexer, so that address balances are automatically updated and maintained in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /blocks with valid block data THEN the system SHALL process the block and update all affected address balances
2. WHEN a block contains multiple transactions THEN the system SHALL process all transactions atomically within that block
3. WHEN block processing fails due to invalid data THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response and not modify any balances
4. WHEN a block is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL return a success confirmation with the processed block height

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blockchain application user, I want to query the current balance of any address, so that I can display accurate balance information in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /balance/:address with a valid address THEN the system SHALL return the current balance for that address
2. WHEN querying a balance for an address that has never been involved in any transactions THEN the system SHALL return a balance of zero
3. WHEN querying a balance with an invalid address format THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
4. WHEN the balance query is successful THEN the system SHALL return the balance in a consistent numeric format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blockchain infrastructure operator, I want to rollback the indexer state to a specific block height, so that I can handle blockchain reorganizations and maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /rollback with a valid height parameter THEN the system SHALL revert all address balances to their state at that block height
2. WHEN rolling back to a height that is greater than the current indexed height THEN the system SHALL return an error response
3. WHEN rolling back to a valid height THEN the system SHALL remove all blocks and balance changes after that height
4. WHEN a rollback operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return confirmation of the new current height
5. WHEN rolling back to height 0 THEN the system SHALL reset all balances to zero and clear all block history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the indexer to handle concurrent requests safely, so that balance data remains consistent under high load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple block processing requests are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them in sequential order to maintain consistency
2. WHEN balance queries are made during block processing THEN the system SHALL return consistent balance data without race conditions
3. WHEN a rollback operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL reject new block submissions until rollback completes
4. WHEN the system encounters database errors THEN the system SHALL maintain transactional integrity and not leave balances in an inconsistent state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a blockchain application developer, I want the indexer to validate block data integrity, so that only valid blocks affect the balance calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving block data THEN the system SHALL validate that required fields (height, transactions, addresses, amounts) are present and properly formatted
2. WHEN block height is not sequential to the last processed block THEN the system SHALL reject the block with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN transaction amounts are negative or invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the entire block
4. WHEN address formats are invalid within transactions THEN the system SHALL reject the block and return validation errors
